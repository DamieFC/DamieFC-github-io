		<h1>Trying to Figure Out the GNU/Linux Kernel-What I've found</h1>
			<h3><a href="index.html">BACK TO BLOG</a></h3>
				<p>Ok, so, this is my first post, so I hope it doesn't suck. It's about how the heck the GNU/Linux kernel is organized, because I found it VERY complicated at first.</p>
				<p>/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\</p>
			<h2>The actual stuff</2>
				<p>I'm going to go in alphabetical (alpha beta cal) order. We are starting with the <code>arch</code> folder.</p>
			<h2>THE <code>arch<code> FOLDER</2>
				<p>This seems to have the information for different SoCs, for example, ARM and x86.</p>
			<h2>THE <code>block</code> FOLDER</h2>
				<p>I have no idea.</p>
			<h2>THE <code>Documentation</code> FOLDER</h2>
				<p>Literally documentation for the Linux kernel.</p>
			<h2>THE <code>LICENSES</code> FOLDER
				<p>All the different very boring licenses that are used in the Linux kernel.</p>
			<h2>THE <code>certs</code> FOLDER
				<p>Best guess judging from files (blacklist.c, blacklist.h, system_certificates.S), it's for blacklisting people and making sure everything is secure.</p>
			<h2>THE <code>drivers</code> FOLDER</h2>
				<p>This has alllll the device drivers, and when uploading to my OS's Google Drive folder, it took overnight there were so many dang files!</p>
			<h2>THE <code>fs</code> FOLDER</h2>
				<p>This has the information for different filesystems, e.g, the Unix filesystem and the FAT filesystem.</p>
