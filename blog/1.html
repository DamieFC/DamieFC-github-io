            <h1>What I want to see in the C2X standard</h1>
            <p>Well, this is my first post, I hope it doesn't suck. Too bad.</p>
            <p>At the end of this year, bigwigs and standard fanatics are gonna vote on the C2X standard. In case they see this, here are some things I want.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>(#)print</code> to be a preprocessor statement or keyword to print text</li>
                <li>A built-in logging function or keyword or something</li>
                <li>A string variable type</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have other things, and this may be updated. Still, it doesn't seem that hard.</p>
